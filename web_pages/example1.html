        <p>Very rarely was my college friend group ever to all meet up in the same place at the same time due to class
            schedules.</p>
        <P>Since we had never gotten more than 7 of us 8 together for a photo, I decided to take this picture of us
            eating lunch together in the Student Union on our campus and insert my friend who was missing here.</P>
        <p>It may be hard to spot her, but she's center-right in the group in the after picture.</p>
        <p>I tried my best to get the lighting on my friend consistent with the rest of us, and although I could have
            done better, I'm still pretty proud of it!</p>
