        <p>I realized that I didn't have a good computer background of me with my high school friends, so I decided to
            make this.</p>
        <p>Yeah, there's no cute story or anything with this one. I just made it because I wanted to.</p>
        <p>This is my favorite photoshop that I have done because it was the most difficult and most satisfying one to
            do out of my collection.</p>
        <p>For one, I had to fill in holes left in the background from removing the faces of the children.</p>
        <p>I also managed to get the lighting on most of the heads to match the picture, all except for one. Sorry
            James.</p>
        <p>What I impressed myself with the most, however, is that I gave the kid in the middle a completely new ice
            cream in his hand and it fits in seamlessly.</p>
        <p>Overall, I really wouldn't change anything about this one. Like I said, it's my favorite creation to date.
